# to do

- fix sliders so they function properly
    - make sure ok button removes the slider menu
    - make sure timer actually edits the time displayed
    - add presets to timer so people can save settings
    - make assets for slider (make tomato icon for dot and have bar be green)
    - fix slider formatting

- add responsiveness to buttons
    - make button zoom a bit when highlighting 

- add different variations for "time for a break" message
    - have them randomize
    - after 4 cycles: "wow you worked hard, you deserve a longer break!"
